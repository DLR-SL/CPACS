# CPACS
The Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema (**CPACS**) is a data definition for the air transportation system. CPACS enables engineers to exchange information between their tools. It is therefore a driver for multi-disciplinary and multi-fidelity design in distributed environments. CPACS describes the characteristics of aircraft, rotorcraft, engines, climate impact, fleets and mission in a structured, hierarchical manner. Not only product but also process information is stored in CPACS. The process information helps in setting up workflows for analysis modules. Due to the fact that CPACS follows a central model approach, the number of interfaces is reduced to a minimum.

## CPACS Tutorial Video: How-to Create a Wing

Have a look at our first [tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgYWfc5N-Xw) video for CPACS. It explains how to create a wing in CPACS. Thanks to Till and Erwin for their work!
